# Speech Recognition-Based Device Control – CodTech Internship

This project implements a basic speech-controlled system to turn ON/OFF a device using Arduino and Bluetooth.

## 🔧 Components Used
- Arduino UNO
- Bluetooth Module (HC-05)
- Android Phone (with speech recognition app)
- Relay Module / LED
- Jumper Wires, Breadboard

## 🧠 How It Works
1. User speaks a command like "Turn ON light"
2. Android app converts it to a character like '1'
3. Arduino receives command via Bluetooth
4. Arduino turns on LED (or relay module)

## 🖼️ Deliverables
- `speech_recognition_control.ino`: Code file
## 🎓 Internship
CodTech Solutions – Embedded System Task 3
